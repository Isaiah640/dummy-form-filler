Dummy Form Filler for Firefox
------

**Simple extension that populates HTML forms with dummy data. 
Useful for web developers and testers.**

####Features:
- Lack of features
- Works out of the box.
- Perceives basic semantic hints (e.g. when a label contains 'age', 'year', 'phone' strings) and limitations (e.g. min, minlength)
- Click again to reset all forms (should keep the original values)
- Supported elements:
 - input: text, email, number, radio, checkbox, tel, password, date, url
 - select
 - textarea
 
####Installation:
Download **bin/dummy-form-filler.xpi** file and drag it over a Firefox window. Some OCPD-touchy icon should appear on the Toolbar.

#####TODO:
- support for other HTML elements
- consider patterns (for date, numbers, etc.)
